# Optimization Methods Final Project
## Airline Cargo optimization
### M. Kuester

Overview:
A cargo airline seeks an optimal weekly movement cycle for their 1200 planes strong fleet between three airports. Holding a cargo load in an airport results in a cost dependent on the length of the stay. Moving empty planes between the airports to satisfy the demand of the system also causes a cost. The airline wants to minimize the total cost of their logistic operation. It is known in advance how much cargo needs to be delivered from each origin to destination airport on a particular day.
